Author : Sumod Madhavan

An implementation of a multidimensional knapsack problem.

Attempts to fit all of the items into a given number of locations while
maintaining, as close to, an even distribution across the locations.

Takes into account the weight and value of each item, and the maximum fill
of a location. The value of an item is used as a priority.
